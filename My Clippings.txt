What shall I do to strengthen my spirit? Do not tell lies, or do what you despise. What shall I do to ennoble my body? Use it only in the service of my soul. What shall I do with the most difficult of questions? Consider them the gateway to the path of life. What shall I do with the poor man’s plight? Strive through right example to lift his broken heart. What shall I do when the great crowd beckons? Stand tall and utter my broken truths.

For the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: “If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?” And whenever the answer has been “No” for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something … almost everything—all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure—these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. —STEVE JOBS,

(2) If the fund’s assets grow many times larger, will the same results that were achieved when the fund was small be sustained when it is large? (3) To what extent did high expense ratios and/or high portfolio turnover detract from the fund’s performance, or did low expenses and low turnover enhance performance?

When choosing a connector or socket from scratch, we must consider the: • Contacts-make separable electrical connections to the mating part. • Housing-positions, aligns, insulates, and protects the contacts and terminals. • Terminals-make permanent electrical connections to the cable, or printed circuit board (PCB), to which the connector is attached. For almost all connectors and sockets, we must consider the: • Number of contacts. • Contact gender. • Contact plating. • Contact pitch. • Housing style (straight, right-angle, angled). • Mounting arrangements. • Terminal style.
